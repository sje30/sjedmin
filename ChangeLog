2013-05-09  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* R/zzz.R: Remove .First.lib() and use NAMESPACE instead to load 
	shared object.  Update .Last.lib() to .onUnload().


2012-07-23  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* src/sjedmin.c (dminlulbd): Count number of rejects; abort when
	we can't fit any more points in.

2004-06-23  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* src/sjedmin.c (pipp2_lookup): New routine.

2004-05-19  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* R/sjedmin.R (pipp2.lookup): New function.
	(plot.sjedmin): Pass ... to function.

2004-05-10  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* src/sjedmin.c (pipp_lookup, hlookup): New routines.

2004-02-05  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@bushmills.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* R/sjedmin.R (dminlul): Use w to provide window, rather than wid,
	ht.  Add safety check since a lot of code will use dminlul
	(including Ben's.)

2003-12-18  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@bushmills.inf.ed.ac.uk>


	* R/sjedmin.R (plot.sjedmin2, dminlulfix2): Pass "w" boundary
	argument so that dmin points are generated within this window;
	otherwise we have also assume that the p2 population has origin at
	0,0 which makes life difficult.

	* src/sjedmin.c (dminlulfix2): as above.


2003-11-26  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@bushmills.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* src/sjedmin.c (nnd_3d, nnd_n_3d, dminlulfix2): New functions for
	3d dmin simulations and for allowing 2nd population to sit in a layer.

	* R/sjedmin.R (dminlulfix2): New function.

2003-03-17  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@pcg.wustl.edu>

	* src/sjedmin.c (dminl, dminlul): Add new argument QUIET to remove
	stdout from C.
	* R/sjedmin.R (dminl, dminlul): Add new argument QUIET to remove
	stdout from C.

2002-10-31  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* src/sjedmin.c (dminlul): If upper is negative, no constraint on
	upper bound.

2002-09-11  Stephen Eglen  <eglen@thalamus.wustl.edu>

	* R/sjedmin.R (dminsd, dminl, dminlulbd): Make result of class
	"sjedmin" for plotting purposes.
	(sjennd): New function to call the NND routine from R.

	* src/sjedmin.c (sjenndp): New C function to allow NND function to
	be called from R; to do this, we need all arguments passed as pointers.
