[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sje30/sjedmin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sje30/sjedmin)

This is the homepage for the `sjedmin` package in R, for modelling
retinal mosacics (or other spatial point patterns).  It has been used
by me since the early 2000s and I have finally released it on github
in 2020.

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sje30/sjedmin")
```
